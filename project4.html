            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This project was a voluntary illustrative design initiative I undertook for the Museum of Australian Photography’s education program. The brief required me to create a fun, engaging, and audience-appropriate booklet for children to complete while exploring the Wheeler's Hill Library and Arts precinct. The booklet was designed to be printed in-house and offered for free at reception desks and during various children’s programs.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In developing this project, I conducted research on similar educational programs at galleries such as the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) and the Heide Museum of Modern Art. This research provided valuable insights into effective educational strategies and design elements that engage children.</p>
            <p>To enhance visibility and maintain the children's focus on activities, I adopted a flat design style for the booklet. This approach not only ensured clarity but also fostered an enjoyable visual experience, making learning interactive and entertaining.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>This project allowed me to experiment with Adobe Illustrator's new AI vector tool, which I utilised to create basic shapes representing children and natural elements in the background. I customised these elements to align with the overall design aesthetic and the specific requirements outlined in the project brief.</p>
            <p>Collaboration was a crucial aspect of this project. I worked closely with MAPh’s educational coordinator, Ingrid Wood, to ensure that the content aligned with the educational goals of the museum. Additionally, I sought advice from Fiona Arbab, a visiting master’s student specialising in early childhood education. This collaboration enriched the project by incorporating expert insights into child engagement.</p>
            <p>The initial iterations of the booklet required further refinement to ensure that activities were not only clear but also age-appropriate. Feedback from Ingrid and Fiona led to several design iterations, each focusing on enhancing clarity and fun.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Maph Children’s Sculpture Trail booklet is an example of how design can enhance educational experiences for children. Through careful research, collaboration, and iterative design processes, I was able to create an engaging resource that supports the museum's educational initiatives. This project not only allowed me to apply my design skills but also deepened my understanding of creating effective educational materials for children.</p>
